## npm vs npx

- npm is something you already know. which simply manages different node versions.

# Best node package manger

Usually there are 4 tools that devs use to manage their node version

1. nvm ‚Äî The most popular one. It uses curl command to install binary and add .sh script to Terminal which is heavy.
2. nodeenv ‚Äî Pretty fast package manger better than nvm
3. asdf ‚Äî A programming language agnostic manager. It's really handy when you use different programming languages on a daily basis.
4. n ‚Äî a recommended and simply fast.

I switched from nvm to n

[tj/n](https://github.com/tj/n)

**command to remove all the node modules globally**

Before installing 'n' , I planned to remove nvm that is already installed. As part of that, it is also required to remove node modules globally.

```jsx
npm ls -gp --depth=0 | awk -F/ '/node_modules/ && !/\/npm$/ {print $NF}' | xargs npm -g rm
```

<aside>
üí° We are using nvm as an additional step to have node working. We can remove it with the help of n. We can directly instruct them to install `npm install n `

- How to Install n
    
    ## **Installation**
    
    Since you probably already have¬†`node`, the easiest way to install¬†`n`¬†is through¬†`npm`:
    
    ```
    npm install -g n
    
    ```
    
    Once installed,¬†`n`¬†caches¬†`node`¬†versions in subdirectory¬†`n/versions`¬†of the directory specified in environment variable¬†`N_PREFIX`, which defaults to¬†`/usr/local`; and the¬†*active*¬†`node`¬†version is installed under¬†`N_PREFIX`.
    
    To avoid requiring¬†`sudo`¬†for¬†`n`¬†and¬†`npm`¬†global installs, it is suggested you either install to your home directory using¬†`N_PREFIX`, or take ownership of the system directories:
    
    ```
    # make cache folder (if missing) and take ownership
    sudo mkdir -p /usr/local/n
    sudo chown -R $(whoami) /usr/local/n
    # take ownership of node install destination folders
    sudo chown -R $(whoami) /usr/local/bin /usr/local/lib /usr/local/include /usr/local/share
    ```
    

### To give a file permission to execute

```jsx
filefolder$ chmod +x filename.js
```

### How to run JS files in a Shell?

1. If you want to run your JS files inside of a shell, you often use `node filename.js` to run the file.
2. But what if you want to run directly? In that case, the only shell scripts are run.
    1. They are not run directly by `$ [index.sh](http://index.sh)` but by `$ ./index.sh` 
    2. In our case, JS files have .sh extension of the file. So you might need a way for the shell to understand that the script has to be run with node runtime.
    3. One way to do that is by adding shaBANG ‚Üí `#! /user/bin/env node` in the first line of index.js

```jsx
#!/usr/bin/env node
console.log('Hello Saif!'); // Hello Saif! 

$ ./index.js
$ Hello Saif!
```

### How to make your local Javascript file become a command line interface?

1. Once you let Shell know how to run your JS file using `!#` , it's time to put a `package.json` file in the same directory.
2. package.json is the way how node understands things about the project that you are bulding. It's like manifest.json to fdk.
    1. You define a JSON object in the package.json file.
    2. This object has an attribute called `"bin"`  ‚Äî which in linux terminology executables.
    3. Create yet another key with  a keyname which which you want your js file to be executed. Like this `"saif":"index.js"` which allows following.
    4. Once done, `npm link` commands takes the local current code and links it to global node modules. see `/usr/lcoal/bin/**saif** -> /usr/local/lib/node_modules/**saif/index.js**`

### How to publish and search for your npm package?

1. It is fairly easy. All you need to do its `npm whoami` and confirm you are logged in.
2. Commit your changes. But exectue `npm publish`
3. Once published, you can find your pacakge at npm `[npm.im/pacakgename](http://npm.im/pacakgename)` in the browswer when you search for it.

### How to clear any console before your actual node script is run?

1. Whenever you run `npx packageName` the console will show `npx: installed 1 in 1.937s` line.

![nodeCLI%202669f86ef4e74f1e96abb57075d3c808/Untitled%202.png](nodeCLI%202669f86ef4e74f1e96abb57075d3c808/Untitled%202.png)

- There is possibility to remove that line to offer better Developer Experience.
- One obvious way is to use console.clear() so that JS that is executed before that line in index.js is cleared. That means that weird line also clears up.
- Instead awais created this tool called `clear-any-console` npm package that basically does the same on any platform.

### Tool that backs up emojis

[ahmadawais/Emoji-Log](https://github.com/ahmadawais/Emoji-Log)

```bash
# Make sure you're adding under the [alias] block.
[alias]
  # Git Commit, Add all and Push ‚Äî in one step.
  cap = "!f() { git add .; git commit -m \"$@\"; git push; }; f"

  # NEW. 
  new = "!f() { git cap \"üì¶ NEW: $@\"; }; f"
  # IMPROVE.
  imp = "!f() { git cap \"üëå IMPROVE: $@\"; }; f"
  # FIX.
  fix = "!f() { git cap \"üêõ FIX: $@\"; }; f"
  # RELEASE.
  rlz = "!f() { git cap \"üöÄ RELEASE: $@\"; }; f"
  # DOC.
  doc = "!f() { git cap \"üìñ DOC: $@\"; }; f"
  # TEST.
  tst = "!f() { git cap \"ü§ñ TEST: $@\"; }; f"
  # BREAKING CHANGE.
```

- I added the above lines to `.gitconfig`
- Now your can run something like `git new`,`git imp`, `git fix`,`git rlz`, `git doc`,`git tst`

<aside>
üí° We can build something similar tool like Emoji log but with interest of freshworks ecosystem and it's theming in the icon.
