## **Some fun stuff before you proceed — an optional challenge**

Let’s start this journey with a simple challenge. Shall we?

Take this quiz: [https://davidshariff.com/quiz](https://davidshariff.com/quiz/)

***Read this before clicking the above link**: This quiz could hurt your ego, especially if you are/were a frontend developer for sometime. While many things covered in this quiz won’t necessarily be required on a day-to-day basis, this quiz serves as a great tool to understand how many details can be missed while learning frontend development. Results might make you want to revisit fundamentals.*

## **Learning Path**

Journey of learning frontend would approximately look like this:

- Learn HTML/CSS
- Learn Javascript
- Learn to test frontend/UI
- Learn to make the frontend performant

It is recommended that you take a moment to familiarize yourself with the technologies & tools mentioned in the below links as it will help you to become a skilled frontend developer. If one could spend 10-12 hours/week learning and **practicing** it, they will be knowledgeable in about 2-3 months.

1. [Frontend Developer roadmap](https://roadmap.sh/frontend)
2. [Ember.js roadmap](https://github.com/rajasegar/ember-developer-roadmap) (thanks to our own [Rajasegar](https://github.com/rajasegar) for creating this). Though there are many frameworks available, we are picking this as it is the standard here at Freshworks

## **HTML & CSS**

HTML & CSS are the easiest to learn by practicing. For most web applications, a small subset of HTML tags is usually sufficient. With respect to CSS, since design/styling is unique to each project, the best approach would be to learn the core skills — typography, layouts, responsive design, animations, etc. and practise them until you get a strong command in it.

### **Courses**

- [HTML/CSS Basics](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/web-development-v2/) - refer to the *Learning HTML* and *Learning CSS* sections of this course
- [Layouts/Responsive Web Design](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/css-grids-flexbox/)
- [Advanced Layouts](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/advanced-css-layouts/)

    - [Case study on Medium’s CSS Refactor](https://medium.com/@fat/mediums-css-is-actually-pretty-fucking-good-b8e2a6c78b06#.1qak6jir2) - provides insights into scaling CSS for large apps
    - [Case study on Google Photos UI](https://medium.com/google-design/google-photos-45b714dfbed1) - provides a lot of insight into designing highly performant, complex UIs. This article also throws light on how design/usage of good algorithms have a place in UI development as well

### **CSS Tools**

To learn CSS in the most efficient way, here are some very good tools:

[Untitled Database](Happy%20Learn%20Frontend%20c80baddb4492417e9dcc556f9981954f/Untitled%20Database%202428d16c01ca47d7a9cac856a94745dd.csv)

Once you understand the concepts, try to create a few site/page(s) and write the entire css by yourself (instead of easy copy/paste) and this would help you learn the basics correctly.

### **Fonts/Icons/Images**

Using the correct fonts, icons and images plays a significant role in making the pages look perfect and has performance implications.

## **Javascript**

HTML describes the content of the page and CSS helps make the web pages beautiful. Javascript does the rest — adding interactivity to UI components, handling data transactions with servers, updating page content on-the-fly, etc.

Javascript has steadily evolved over the years. With the release of Node.js, it has seen wide adoption as a general-purpose scripting language. Today, Javascript is used extensively outside the browser for writing server-side applications and automation in any compute environment (like development tools, build tools, task automations, etc.).

This document will cover resources for learning the general features of Javascript from a programming perspective — constructs, syntax, scoping, execution loops etc. and their applicability when developing frontend applications. In addition to this, the resources may cover browser APIs that can be used in browser-ready Javascript. Tooling and testing for building high-quality frontend apps is also covered.

## **JavaScript - Testing & Quality**

Quality & Testing is very important to deliver those moments of wow. Nuff said. Here is a good list of tools to make our lives better when it comes to testing and quality assurance

## **Frontend Performance & Security**

Creating intuitive & beautiful user interfaces alone is not sufficient to deliver those moments of wow. It has to be performant (what good is a Tesla when it travels only 7 Kms/hr). It also has to be secure. Listed below are collection of good references to learn from to build a high performing frontend.
