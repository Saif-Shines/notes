Here is a React Project that you should build in the journey of becoming a PRO. This project is an Exercise Planner Application that is built using React.js, React Router and Hooks.

The features of the application that we will be building in this course are:

1. Fetching the list of exercises from a local JSON Server
2. Create a New Exercise
3. Update an already existing exercise
4. Delete an existing exercise
5. Toggling the completion status of an exercise and showing it in visually.
6. Creating a filter component to filter the exercises based on the completion status - pending, all, completed. and more.
