I'm always stumbling upon valuable resources that I know will come in handy down the line.
But, like many of us, I tend to forget where I saved them or even what I saved. It's frustrating when I need to access that information quickly for work and can't seem to find it.
I end up with a long list of saved items that I know I'll never get around to.

That's why I came up with a solution:

- I'm now documenting my learnings publicly and organizing them in a way that's easy to access.
- Not only does this help me stay organized, but it also creates a sense of accountability to keep my materials in order.

I'm excited to see how this new approach will improve my productivity and knowledge retention!
