# Personal Notes

This is my personal knowledge base and reference for things I've learned over the years. It contains links, notes, code snippets, and tutorials collected from courses, books, forums, and my own experience.

The goal is to provide a curated set of documentation that can help others ramp up quickly on both foundational and more advanced skills across a variety of topics.

## I want one too
